# ML101-Darija
You always hear about artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning? Have you searched for them and really want
to learn them? Did you have difficulties?
I think I have a good idea, we can start learning together here. I will write what I know about ai, ml and dl in posts and explain
some basics to you. All this in Darija and every post is a part.

PS1: All photos that you will need wiil be in the Photos folder.

PS2: When I have any error you can correct it in comments.

PS3: When i finish all my parts, someone of you can continue the others parts that i didn't know.

How does this look to you?
